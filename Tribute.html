          <p>Nelson Mandela (1918–2013) was a  <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa">South African</a></span> black nationalist who spent 27 years in prison for fighting against the country’s discriminatory apartheid system of racial segregation. His negotiations in the early 1990s with <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa">South African</a></span> Pres. F.W. de Klerk helped bring an end to 
            <span><a href="https://www.history.com/topics/africa/apartheid#:~:text=Apartheid%20(%E2%80%9Capartness%E2%80%9D%20in%20the,existing%20policies%20of%20racial%20segregation.">apartheid</a></span>
            and ushered in a peaceful transition to majority rule. Mandela served as president (1994–99) of the country’s first multiethnic government.</p>

            Nelson Mandela had a spirit akin to an in-combustible coal; he was an indestructible mold of his kind. Mandela dared history; he transformed human race into a symbol that is held precious by everyone today.
            <br>
            <br>
There can never be any better way to describe Madiba. For me, describing him as the greatest man of my time is a mere scratch on the surface of his personality. He has left imprints of his shades on the sand of posterity. His model of leadership- leading from behind- leaves an inexpungible stamp in the history of mankind. Posterity will always know Madiba crossed this path.
<br>
<br>
I have only met Madiba in books and legends. Of all the people I have met through books and legends Madiba stands out like a beacon in the stormy azure sea. His strongly desirous and autobiographical work, Long Walk to Freedom, written by him and published in 1995 by Little Brown and Co., was my source of inspiration during my days at graduate school in England. One of the greatest things about Madiba that inspired me was that his human nature extended to the core of man’s essence on earth; his loving heart for the poor and destitute was exceptional. He never failed to extend his heartfelt wishes to the entire humanity in respective of race, religion, and sexual orientation.
<br>
<br>
You do not need to be around him before you witness his endearing aura. Madiba was a cynosure (he is still and will always be); his endearing aura is comparable to none. He was the old archetype of probity, universal morality, sacrifice, humility, social justice, and struggle: he played to the hilt. He will continue to be my favorite teacher and leader!!
<br>
Good night Madiba; Adieu Mandela.
